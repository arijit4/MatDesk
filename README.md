# MatDesk
Who needs a _Lab_ to do simple math operations? MatDesk is a minified version of __MatLab__ that only contains the 
basic math operations which are needed for most of the students. This is reduction is planned to make the software
lightweight and easy to use.

> **Note**: This project is currently in its early stages and lacks most of the
> basic functionalities. But who cares? Try it out and contribute making this
> project a successful one. Cheers!
